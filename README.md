# DarkThrone's config files

This are my config files, for anyone that wants to use them. They might not work out of the box for you, but feel free to grab the bits and pieces that you need.

You don't need to give me attribution, knowing they are useful to someone else is already good enough.

## Prerequisites

This config files work under the following assumption

* You are using a Mac
* Your shell is `zsh`
* You are using `zimfw`
* you have `fzf` installed and in your path
* you use either `alacritty` or `wezterm`
